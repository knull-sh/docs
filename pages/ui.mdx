## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup (Bootstrap)
The first time you access the UI, you will be prompted to create the initial Administrator account. This "Bootstrap" phase ensures the system is secured from the start.

### 2. Environment Configuration
The UI communicates with the Knull Admin API. Ensure your environment is configured correctly:

```env
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_KNULL_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Local Development
```bash
cd knull/ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Security & Authentication
The UI uses JWT-based authentication. Session tokens are stored securely in local storage and included in all API requests. For enterprise deployments, ensure the UI is served over HTTPS.
