# Management UI

Knull includes a built-in web dashboard for managing models, monitoring usage, and testing prompts in a playground.

## Getting Started

The UI is built with Next.js and is located in the `knull/ui` directory.

### 1. Installation
Navigate to the UI directory and install dependencies:
```bash
cd knull/ui
npm install
```

### 2. Development Mode
Run the dashboard locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```
The UI will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

### Dashboard
Overview of active gateways, configured models, and real-time token usage metrics.

### Model Management
Add, edit, or remove LLM providers and models through a visual interface. Changes are synchronized with the Knull Core backend.

### API Key Management
Generate and revoke client API keys and manage their associated budget policies.

### AI Playground
A built-in chat interface to test your configured models.
- **Model Selector**: Switch between configured models (e.g., GPT-4 on Azure vs Claude 3.5 on Anthropic).
- **System Prompt**: Customize the system behavior.
- **Token Info**: View the exact token count and cost for each interaction.

## Configuration

The UI communicates with the Knull Admin API (default `:1064`). You can configure the backend URL in `knull/ui/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_KNULL_API_URL=http://localhost:1064
```

> **Note**: Ensure Knull Core is running with the `--admin-port` active for the UI to function correctly.
