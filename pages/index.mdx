# Knull - AI Gateway

Knull is a high-performance, standalone AI Gateway designed to run as a local or edge-resident control plane and data plane for AI traffic. It provides a unified interface for routing requests to multiple LLM providers with built-in observability, authentication, and rate limiting.

## What is Knull?

Knull Core is the standalone foundation of the Knull AI Gateway. It is designed to run as a single executable (`knull`) that manages Envoy and the External Processor without requiring a Kubernetes cluster.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Binary**: Single executable that manages Envoy and the External Processor
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Route to Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Anthropic, GCP VertexAI, and more
- **No Kubernetes Required**: Uses a virtualized control plane to run Envoy Gateway logic locally
- **API Key Management**: Built-in support for client API keys with budget enforcement
- **Token Usage Tracking**: Track token usage per API key and model
- **MCP Support**: Model Context Protocol support for AI tool integration
- **High Availability**: Redis-backed state for multi-instance deployments

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Run with a configuration file
./bin/knull run examples/knull.yaml

# Test the gateway
curl http://localhost:1975/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "hi"}]}'
```

## Architecture

Knull consists of three main components:

1. **Envoy Gateway**: Handles incoming AI traffic and routes to configured backends
2. **External Processor**: Performs request/response processing including token counting, header mutation, and authentication
3. **SQLite Database**: Stores configuration, API keys, and usage data
