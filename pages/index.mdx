# Knull - Enterprise AI Control Plane

Knull is a high-performance, standalone AI Control Plane designed for the modern enterprise. It provides a unified hub for governing AI traffic, managing identity, and orchestrating cloud resources across multiple LLM providers.

## How it Works

Knull consists of an **AI Control Plane** (Knull Core) and a **Data Plane** (Envoy Proxy).

1.  **Unified Hub**: Applications connect to Knull using standard OpenAI-format APIs.
2.  **IAM & Governance**: Knull identifies users via teams/orgs, enforces RBAC, and validates token budgets.
3.  **Cloud Provisioning**: Knull can directly provision models in AWS Bedrock and track costs using native cloud metrics.
4.  **Extensive Observability**: Track every request with audit logs, time-series analytics, and cost-flow diagrams.

## Key Features

- **🛡️ Enterprise IAM**: Multi-tenant RBAC with support for Teams, Organizations, and Email Invites.
- **☁️ Cloud Native**: One-click provisioning for AWS Bedrock with IAM Assume Role support.
- **📊 Advanced Analytics**: Cost tracking via Sankey diagrams, Time-series analysis, and AWS Cost Explorer integration.
- **🚀 High Performance**: Built on Envoy Proxy with a Go-based External Processor for sub-millisecond overhead.
- **🛠️ Developer First**: Native MCP support and a built-in AI Playground for testing and iteration.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Start Knull with an example config
./bin/knull run examples/knull.yaml
```

### 2. Configure a Provider

Set your API key as an environment variable (Knull automatically substitutes these in YAML):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 3. Test the Hub

```bash
curl http://localhost:1975/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Knull!"}]
  }'
```
