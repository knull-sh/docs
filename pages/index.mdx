# Knull - AI Control Plane

Knull is a high-performance, standalone AI Control Plane designed to run as a local or edge-resident control plane and data plane for AI traffic. It provides a unified interface for routing requests to multiple LLM providers with built-in observability, authentication, and budget enforcement.

## How it Works

Knull consists of a **Control Plane** (Knull Core) and a **Data Plane** (Envoy Proxy).

1.  **Unified API**: Your applications send OpenAI-format requests to Knull.
2.  **Routing & Policy**: Knull identifies the client via API key, checks their token budget, and selects the optimal backend model.
3.  **Translation**: If the backend is not OpenAI (e.g., Anthropic or Bedrock), Knull's **External Processor (ExtProc)** translates the request on the fly.
4.  **Observability**: Knull counts every token and logs usage to its internal database.

## Key Features

- **Standalone Binary**: Single executable manages Envoy and the External Processor without Kubernetes.
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Unified access to Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, AWS Bedrock, GCP VertexAI, and more.
- **Token Budgets**: Enforce granular token limits per API key and per model.
- **MCP Support**: Native Model Context Protocol proxying for AI tool integration.
- **Management UI**: Built-in Next.js dashboard for monitoring and configuration.

## Quick Start

### 1. Build and Run

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# Start Knull with an example config
./bin/knull run examples/knull.yaml
```

### 2. Configure a Provider

Set your API key as an environment variable (Knull automatically substitutes these in YAML):

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
```

### 3. Test the Gateway

```bash
curl http://localhost:1975/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello Knull!"}]
  }'
```
